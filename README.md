# Adidas-Sales-Analysis
In this project, I designed and developed a comprehensive sales analysis dashboard for Adidas, 
providing an in-depth and interactive overview of sales performance across various metrics in the USA. 
This dashboard offers valuable insights to stakeholders for informed decision-making.
# Key Features:
1. Key Performance Indicators (KPI):
Displayed crucial figures such as Total sales ($16M), Operating profit ($131M), Units sold (1M), Price per Unit ($41), Operating Margin (41%), offering a quick snapshot of overall performance. 
Interactive Feature: When Users click on any state, it shows specific sales numbers for that state.
2. Total Sales by Month: Illustrated monthly sales trends using a line graph, highlighting significant revenue peaks in January ($5.7) and February ($7.0).
3. Total Sales by Geography: Visualized sales distribution across the USA with a map showing sales performance by state, and donut chart indicating 100 % of total sales in the Midwest region.
4. Product Performance: Presented sales figures across various product categories, including women's and men's apparel and footwear, through horizontal bar charts.
5. Retailer Performance: Highlighted sales distribution among key retailers, with Kohl's ($43M) and Sport Direct ($53M), using horizontal bar charts.
6. Filter for Customized Insights: Included filters for Region and Invoice, enabling stakeholders to tailor the data view according to their specific needs, with a date range from January 2020 to April 2021.
